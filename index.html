			<h2>Travel</h2>
			<p>
				Traveling has always been a very big thing for me since it allows me to discover completely different worlds and cultures that are very enriching to my persona. People dont realize how different every country and culture is until they travel. I find traveling very interesting and immersing myself in new foreign environments is one of my favorite things to do

			<h2>Hiking</h2>
			<p>
				Hiking is my favorite way to get some exercise. It's peaceful, calm and entertaining. Whenever I'm hiking I feel so at peace and like I'm reconnecting with nature. Especially after moving to a place like Cergy I have felt the need to really go and hike and breathe some real fresh air from the mountains. Hiking is also a passion of mine because of all the beautiful nature that you get to see along the way whether its an animal or a water fountain or a view. Whenever I go hiking I find beautiful things that I would never be able to see in my normal day to day city life.

			<h2>Ski</h2>
			<p>
				Ever since I learned how to ski when I was 9 years old it has become a great passion for me. I never feel more at peace and in happiness then when im skiing. I am very lucky that in the place where I used to live I had a ski slope at 15 minutes from my house. This not only let me develop my ski skills but also allowed me to take part in ski competitions and allowed me to become a ski instructor wich was a very enriching experience.
